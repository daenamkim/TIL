# JavaScript Chart Libraries

- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
- [HIGHCHARTS](https://www.highcharts.com/)
- [C3](http://c3js.org/)
- [NVD3](http://nvd3.org/)
- [CHARTIST.JS](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/)
- [Plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/)
- [VICTORY](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/) for React only.

And I decided to use `Plotly.js` because it supports many different types of chats and React as well.
