# Yarn Self-Update.

I tried `$ yarn self-update` but an error occurred as below.

```
error An unexpected error occurred: "Command \"self-update\" not found.".
```

So I searched that issue and I realized it is no longer available [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/self-update/).

What I tried is as below and I cleared an issue.

```
$ npm install yarn -g
```
