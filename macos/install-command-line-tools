# Install Command Line Tools

When I tried to build some codes in macOS I confronted a problem as below.

```
xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance
```

### Solution

```
$ sudo xcodebuild -license
```

Note that Xcode must be installed prior to installing the command line tool.
