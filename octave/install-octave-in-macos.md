# Install Octave in MacOS

In order to do some homeworks and exmaples in [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course, I need to install [Octive](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) or MATLAB.

```sh
$ brew update && brew upgrade
$ brew install octave
```

NOTE: Xcode must be installed before installing.
