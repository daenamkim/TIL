# Packages for Web App in ReactJS

I thought about good packages for the development of ReactJS web app as below.
Everything refreshes me and I'm really thrilled to start a new project with these.

- Web Server: [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- JS Libray: [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
- Router: [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
- State Management: [react-redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- AJAX: [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- Async Process: [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/))
- Localizing: [react-localize-redux](https://ryandrewjohnson.github.io/react-localize-redux/getting-started/)
