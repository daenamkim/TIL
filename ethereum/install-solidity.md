# Install Solidity

### Install a specific version of Solidity

If you need a specific version of Solidity you can install a Homebrew formula directly from Github.

View [solidity.rb commits on Github](https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/commits/master/solidity.rb).

Follow the history links until you have a raw file link of a specific commit of solidity.rb.

Install it using brew:

```sh
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/77cce03da9f289e5a3ffe579840d3c5dc0a62717/solidity.rb

```
